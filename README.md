# p2p-chat

This is an example taken from the [libp2p GitHub repository](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p/tree/master) demonstrating a simple peer-to-peer (p2p) chat application using the libp2p library.

### Overview
This project is a basic peer-to-peer (p2p) chat application that allows communication between peers over a network using libp2p. It demonstrates how to set up a p2p host, establish connections between peers, and send/receive messages over a secure communication stream.

### Features:
- Peer Discovery: Nodes can connect using multiaddresses.
- Stream Communication: Once connected, peers can communicate over streams.
- Basic Chat Functionality: Send and receive messages between connected peers.
- Multiaddress: Utilize libp2p's multiaddress format for addressing peers.
